# NYC CRIMES EDA
# An exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization for crime in NYC from the start of 2024 up to this date
We decided to study borough related crimes, times of high crime activities, date related felonies and occurrence from gender identification. In particular to see the most dangerous borough in NYC. Our raw data contained over 50k observations from the start of the year till now. We limit our data to this past months to be able to work with that and not over complicate.
