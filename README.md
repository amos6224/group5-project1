# NYC CRIMES EDA
# An exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization for crime in NYC from the start of 2024 up to this date
We decided to study borough related crimes, times of high crime activities, date related felonies and occurrence from gender identification. In particular to see the most dangerous borough in NYC. Our raw data contained over 50k observations from the start of the year till now. We limit our data to this past months to be able to work with that and not over complicate.

# Introduction

Nyc has a variety of open and transparent data for our study . On this case we used NYC OPEN DATA a city public data company data generated by various nyc agencies and other city organizations available for public use. As part of an initiative to improve the accessibility, transparency and accountability of city government.  It offers to a repository of government- produced, searchable data sets available for download.  

We did our EDA based on evidence from 2023/2024. Basing our analysis grouping by borough related crimes. Sorting offenses by count, race, gender. 

This EDA can be useful for law and enforcement and government data crime. Our purpose with this project is to help our communities, examining factors, patterns, and variables in NYC crime rates.
